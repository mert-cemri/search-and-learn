This gives f(-1) = (3(-1)-2)\/(-1-2) = (-3-2)\/(-3) = -5\/-3 = 5\/3.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate f(0)\nTo find f(0), substitute x = 0 into the function f(x) = (3x-2)\/(x-2), but this will result in division by zero. Since x cannot be 2, we cannot find f(2). However, the function is undefined at x=2. The function f(x) was f(x) = (3x-2)\/(x-2). Let us re-write the function as f(x) = 3 + 5\/(x-2), since f(x) = 3x-2\/(x-2) is equivalent to 3+(5\/(x-2)), if the denominator can approach zero, then the denominator can not be 0, thus we have, f(0) = 3 + 5\/(-2) = 3 + (-5\/2) = 3 - 5\/2 = (6-5)\/2 = 1\/2.\n\n## Step 4: Sum the values\nTo find the final answer, add the values obtained in the previous steps: f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + 5\/3 + 1\/2. To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 2 is 6. Rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 6: 2 = 12\/6 ( multiply numerator and denominator by 6), 5\/3 = (5*2)\/(3*2) = 10\/6, and 1\/2 = (1*3)\/(2*3) = 3\/6.

{"problem":"How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?","solution":"First prime factorize $196=2^2\\cdot7^2$.  The prime factorization of any divisor of 196 cannot include any primes other than 2 and 7.
