Since 30 = 2 * 3 * 5, the number must be divisible by 2, 3, and 5.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the divisibility requirements by 2, 3, and 5\nFor a number to be divisible by 2, it must end in 0 or 2, but since we're only using 0 and 2, it must end in 2. For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Since we're only using 0 and 2, we can use two 2's to meet this requirement.\n\n## Step 3: Find the smallest multiple that meets all requirements\nThe smallest multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2 is 2220, since it's the smallest number that meets all the requirements for divisibility by 2, 3, and 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{2220}$.","completion_tokens":[0],"scores":[[-696.2209472656,-1242.5711669922,-1795.1242675781,-2216.6726074219,-2134.3781738281]],"runtime":4.5923864841,"agg_scores":[-2134.3781738281],"pred_weighted@1":"\\boxed{2220}","pred_maj@1":"\\boxed{2220}","pred_naive@1":"\\boxed{2220}","pred_weighted@2":"\\boxed{2220}","pred_maj@2":"\\boxed{2220}","pred_naive@2":"\\boxed{2220}","pred_weighted@4":"\\boxed{2220}","pred_maj@4":"\\boxed{2220}","pred_naive@4":"\\boxed{2220}"}
