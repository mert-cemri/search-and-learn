{"problem":"What is the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers?","solution":"The sum of three consecutive integers takes the form $(k-1)+(k)+(k+1)=3k$ and hence is a multiple of 3.  Conversely, if a number $n$ is a multiple of 3, then $n\/3-1$, $n\/3$, and $n\/3+1$ are three consecutive integers that sum to give $n$.  Therefore, a number is a sum of three consecutive integers if and only if it is a multiple of 3.  The smallest positive perfect cube that is a multiple of 3 is $3^3=\\boxed{27}$.","answer":"27","subject":"Number Theory","level":3,"unique_id":"test\/number_theory\/515.json","completions":["## Step 1: Understand the nature of the problem\nWe need to find the smallest positive perfect cube that can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers.
